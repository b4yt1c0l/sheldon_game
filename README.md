Game rules are really "simple":

- rock smashes scissors, and smashes lizard

- paper covers rock, and disproves Spock

- scissors cuts paper, and cuts the head off of lizard

- lizard eats paper, and poisons Spock

- Spock vaporizes rock, and smashes scissors

But users don't need to know the rules, they can just try their lucky.
