Sheldon Game is a Big Bang Theory funny version of the most popular "Rock, Paper, Scissor" avtivity. It is made more complicated by adding two more variables, thus becoming "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock".
It is an easy game and users don't need to know the rules to play. However you can find the rules explained in the website.

## Rules

Game rules are really "simple":

- rock smashes scissors, and smashes lizard

- paper covers rock, and disproves Spock

- scissors cuts paper, and cuts the head off of lizard

- lizard eats paper, and poisons Spock

- Spock vaporizes rock, and smashes scissors

But users don't need to know the rules, they can just try their lucky.
